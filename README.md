# MizuchiLabs

**We build small, sharp tools for niche problems.**

Like the mythical water dragon, we flow around obstacles, usually with a CLI and questionable amounts of YAML.

---

### What we do

- **DevOps tools** that probably should've existed already
- **CLI utilities** for problems you didn't know you had
- **Web apps** for the 12 people who need them

### Philosophy

```
if it's annoying → automate it
if it's complex → simplify it
if it works → ship it
```

### Tech we like

`Go` · `Svelte` · `Containers` · `Kubernetes` · `kubectl apply -f hopes-and-dreams.yaml`
